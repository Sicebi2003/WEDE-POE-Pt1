Business Proposal.

Efficient Energy is a fully Black-owned business that is located just outside Johannesburg CBD and offers products throughout the South African region of SADC. The founders of EE (Pty) Ltd have combined their skills within the business sector, together with favorable market conditions we will supply the demand. 
The vision of EE is to expand beyond only providing wholesalers licenses and becoming the owner of the largest mining, storage facilities and distributors in the SADC region and Africa. We aim to impact the economy of South Africa, through job opportunities and people empowerment. Customer excellence will set EE apart from its competition. EE is strategically linked to producers/suppliers such as Total SA, Sasol, Afrox, and FuelX. EE will ensure no interruption in the supply of its products, making it a dependable supplier to the market.

VALUE PROPOSTITION

Efficient Energy (Pty) Ltd aims to provide the most convenient and efficient services within the petroleum industry. We offer flexible and responsive delivery services for:
	Hospitals
	Malls and Shopping Centres
	Educational institutions
	Office buildings 
	Individuals
Load shedding is a major problem in South Africa, where, according to Fraser (2023), the entire SA economy loses approximately R650 bn - R850 bn (business sector combined) annually as a direct result of these power outages, this is R54 Mn monthly. According to Woosey (2023), the current diesel costs R25.50. Experts have assessed that this problem will exist for a very long time. Efficient Energy aims to reduce these figures significantly. Large enterprises (hospitals, malls, and large retailers/wholesalers) spend approximately R12 000 000 (R1m monthly) on diesel annually, this is 470 600 litres of 50PP diesel which is sold at R25.50 a litre. We intend to sell diesel 50PP for R20, which the same amount of diesel will cost R9 412 000 (R784 000 per month) annually. This will save businesses R2 600 000 annually (R216 700 monthly) and assist in saving lives as the lights and machines at hospitals will be operating. 

According to Du Toit (2023), individuals spend approximately R18 000 annually (R1500 monthly) purchasing diesel and petrol at R25 per litre. We will save individuals R3000 monthly as they will be spending R1200 at EE (Pty) Ltd; and because we deliver, any emergency can be mitigated for our customers, maybe the customer ran out of fuel while far from any filling stations, our fast team will make sure that the car is filled, and the customer is ready to continue with their journey. 


Current Website Analysis

Now, Efficient Energy runs a simple informational webpage.  Although it offers broad information on the business and its offerings, a number of flaws restrict its usefulness:

•	Static pages with outdated designs that don't encourage interaction.
•	Inadequate mobile responsiveness, which limits smartphone users' accessibility.
•	Limited resources for interacting with customers, like newsletters, live 
chat and order forms.
•	Poor search engine optimization (SEO), which indicates that the brand is not as well-known online as its rivals.

Making a brand-new, completely dynamic website is crucial for these reasons.  The proposed website would enhance customer involvement, modernize the company's online presence, and offer features that complement Efficient Energy's expansion plans in South Africa and the SADC.
